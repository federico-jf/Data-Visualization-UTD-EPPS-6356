* Democratization in data visualization.
* Skills:
      **put data in context
      **use (your) data efficiently and transform it in order to generate visualizations
      **TELL a history with your data
      **Construct interactive charts, is the key (interactive slideshades, drill down story, etc)
      **Construct animations
      ** GRAPHIC DESIGN + PROGRAMMING + STATISTICS
      
* A general problem today: visualizations beautifully constructed but still incomprensibles. "Beautiful but impossible to interpret". 
These pieces are effective at the beginning because they engage the reader but then frustrate them when they try to understand.
* New era in infographics: we can see now more statistics pieces.
* A good visualization: clean, nice organization, interactive.
* Problem: convert data into visualizations. Promotion of open data. Tools for data visualization for everyone (cell phones).
* Tools: Flash, JAVA.
* Importance of exploring examples of visualizations. Use of templates.
